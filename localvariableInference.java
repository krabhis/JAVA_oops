public class localvariableInference {
    
}



/*
 Local type variable inference in Java, introduced in Java 10 with the var keyword, allows the type of a local variable to be inferred(guessed) by the compiler based on the context in which it is used. This can make code more concise and readable by reducing redundancy in variable declarations.

=>LIMITATIONS

 *var can only be used for local variables, not for fields, method parameters, or return types.

*var requires an initializer; you cannot declare a variable with var without assigning a value.

*var cannot be used with array initializers without explicit type
